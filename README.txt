## Message Generator Project
For this project, I built a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output.
As it was asked to personalize it however I prefer, I selected and stored quotes from a great thinker called Michael Scott. 
Divide them into 3 parts (each one in a different array) and randomly put them together to generate a new fake quote.
